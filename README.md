# PyJPG2PNG
This simple python code takes in a folder full of .jpg files and converts them to .png files in a new folder. <br/><br/>
Why? Bulk conversion was necessary when we are working with Photoshop or other image processing software and the images given as assets to work with are incompatible; thus the code transforms the incompatible pictures to ones that can be used in Photoshop without any hassle. Can be used for other picture conversion types with a little twerking.<br/><br/>
This code uses the skeleton GUI from one of datatofish.com posts
